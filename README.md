Very early version of Owler as we know today, from October 21st 2023. Very few stuff are working, and as this was when I was learning Flask and MongoDB, I don't recommend using this source at all. But it's there for archival purposes.

## Things that are working
- Accounts
- Registration
- Profile pages
- Some static pages

## Install
Python 3.9> is required.

### Steps
- A mongoDB server is required, you can install it here: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- Create a pyvenv;
- Install the requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start a development server using `flask --app api.index:app run`
